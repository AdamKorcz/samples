# alternates  is used to inform NeoMutt about alternate addresses where you
# receive mail; you can use regular expressions (regex) to specify
# alternate  addresses.  This  affects NeoMutt's idea about messages from
# you, and messages addressed to you.  unalternates  can be used to write
# exceptions to alternates patterns. To remove a regu‐ lar expression from
# the alternates list, use the unalternates command with exactly  the same
# regex or use “*” to remove all entries.  The  optional  -group flag
# causes all of the subsequent regular expressions to be added to or
# removed from the named group.

# alternates mymailbox@domain.tld
# alternates mymailbox@work.tld
