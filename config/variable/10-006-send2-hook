# Name: send-hook 
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These  commands  can be used to execute arbitrary configuration commands
# based upon recipients of the message. pattern is used to match the
# message, see section “Message Matching in Hooks” in manual for details.
# command is executed when pattern matches.
#
# reply-hook is matched against the message you are replying to, instead of the
# message you are sending. send-hook is matched against all messages, both new
# and replies. Note,  reply-hooks  are matched before the send-hook, regardless
# of the order specified in the user's configuration file.
#
# send2-hook  is  matched  every  time a message is changed, either by editing
# it, or by using the compose menu to change its recipients or subject.
# send2-hook is executed after send-hook, and can, e.g., be used to set
# parameters such as the $sendmail variable depending on the message's sender
# address. Note, send-hooks are only executed once after getting the initial
# list of recip‐ ients.
