# The Basics

The 'index' is the screen that you usually see first when you
start NeoMutt. It gives an overview over your emails in the
currently opened mailbox. By default, this is your system
mailbox. The information you see in the index is a list of
emails, each with its number on the left, its flags (new
email, important email, email that has been forwarded or
replied to, tagged email, ...), the date when email was
sent, its sender, the email size, and the subject.
Additionally, the index also shows thread hierarchies: when
you reply to an email, and the other person replies back,
you can see the other person's email in a "sub-tree" below.
This is especially useful for personal email between a group
of people or when you've subscribed to mailing lists.
